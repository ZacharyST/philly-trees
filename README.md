### Visualizing PhillyTreeMap.org User Contributions over time

Four visualizations that use data from PhillyTreeMap.org and the CartoDB Torque.js library to display user contributions of trees and tree planting sites (plots) in and around Philadelphia from 06/21/2011 - 07/24/2012.

PhillyTreeMap.org is an implementation of the open source (GPL) [OpenTreeMap](http://github.com/azavea/OpenTreeMap] project, a comprehensive web application developed by [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com/) in collaboration with many partners, designed to leverage crowdsourcing and citizen science for accurate, efficient, and collaborative urban forestry inventories and eco-benefit calculation.

Andrew Thompson (Community Evangelist at Azavea) authored these maps in conjunction with the [Azavea Labs](http://www.azavea.com/blogs/labs/) blog series, "Open Data from OpenTreeMap". Credit is due to Mark Headd, whose [philly-homicides](http://github.com/mheadd/philly-homicides/) project provided a starting point and inspiration.
