<h1>PhillyTreeMap User Edits: Time-based visualizations with CartoDB Torque</h1>
<p>These maps were created by Andrew Thompson at Azavea for the Azavea Labs blog series, "Open Data from OpenTreeMap". The links take you to full screen pages - please use your browser's Back button to get back to this page and see another.</p>
<h2>Non-cumulative visualizations</h2>
<p>These include all PhillyTreeMap edits from Spring 2011 to July 2013, but due to the volume of data points, they are non-cumulative. IE, data points appear and disappear on the map as time passes.</p>

<h2>Cumulative visualizations</h2>
<p>These include only PhillyTreeMap edits after the initial bulk imports of tens of thousands of trees and plots when the site launched in spring 2011. Because this cuts back on the volume of data, these visualizations can afford to be cumulative. Points stay on the map persistently as time passes.</p>
